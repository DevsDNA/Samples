Reactive Examples in Xamarin
============================
This repository contains examples of using the [Microsoft Reactive Extensions (Rx)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg577609.aspx), specifically the [Rx.NET](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/Rx.NET) extensions in a Xamarin application with Android and iOS implementations.

The examples include several variations on reacting to text field updates, working with a color slider to change values, and scenarios for fetching internet data and dealing with server response times and reliability.

Also added reactiveUI examples
